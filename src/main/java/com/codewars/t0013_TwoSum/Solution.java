Output
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

Based on: http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

two_sum([1, 2, 3], 4) == {0, 2}

public class Solution {
    public static int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] result = new int[2];

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    result[0] = i;
                    result[1] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
